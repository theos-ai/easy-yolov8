### Install all the dependencies
Always install the requirements inside a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Fix dependencies
If you run into issues installing some dependencies, first make sure you installed them inside a virtual environment.
For cython-bbox, try installing it like this:
```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/samson-wang/cython_bbox.git#egg=cython-bbox
```

### Detect the image

```
python image.py
```

### Detect the webcam

```
python webcam.py
```

### Detect the video

```
python video.py
```

### Detect multiple live video streams in parallel

Create a new text file called **streams.txt** inside the repository folder and put the URLs of the streams in each new line, for example:

```
https://192.168.0.203:8080/video
https://192.168.0.204:8080/video
https://192.168.0.205:8080/video
```

Then execute the streams script.

```
python streams.py
```

## Train YOLOv8 on your own custom dataset

Watch the following tutorial to learn how to do it.

### Click the weights button

Go to your training experiment and click the weights button on the top right corner.

### Download the files

Download the best or last weights and the classes YAML file and put them inside the repository folder.

### Use your own custom model

Change the following line to use your custom model.

``` Python
yolov8.load('best.weights', classes='classes.yaml', device='cpu') # use 'gpu' for CUDA GPU inference
```
